# World-Happiness-Survey-Analysis

This data was sourced from Kaggle. It is a world happiness survey conducted by Gallup World Poll that surveys over 160 countries that ask residents how their life is going.

This project was focused on conducting an analysis to see which variables correlated best with happiness scores. We used wealth, health, and governmental trust as our indicators.

Our data is cleaned so that all null values per country were replaced with the median value for the indicator.

Here is a link to the Tableau dashboard of the analysis: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shannon1243/viz/AnalysisofWorldHappinessSurvey/Story1?publish=yes
